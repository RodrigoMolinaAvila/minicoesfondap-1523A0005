    "This study examines how Chilean think tanks strategically shaped public discourse during a period of exceptional political turbulence between 2019 and 2023. By analyzing a corpus of over 30,000 media publications—including op-eds, columns, and press releases—we investigate how these non-elected policy actors used language to influence debates on reproductive rights, plurinationality, and constitutional reform. Combining topic modeling (LDA), TF-IDF, and semantic vectorization with BERT-based emotion analysis, we trace the evolution of thematic and emotional framing across political orientations and media platforms."
